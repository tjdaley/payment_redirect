## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, send an email to security@attorney.bot, providing as much information as you can.

Once we receive a security vulnerability report, we will review it. If we accept it after the review, we will fix it in the next release. We might create an immediate release, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

We will email you with updates on the status of our review and any actions taken to remediate the vulnerability, including instructions for upgrading or patching your installation.
