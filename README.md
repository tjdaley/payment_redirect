## Purpose
Make it easy for clients to make the required payment on their account.
Authorized users set up a client record and update it with the amount
the client is required to pay to bring their account up to date. When the
client visits the URL and enters identifying information, the client is
redirected to a payment URL with the amount pre-filled.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/tjdaley/payment_redirect
```

## Implemented Utilities

Authenticates an administrative user and let's the user CRUD client
records including payment due amount and date.
